    <h3>Web Developer</h3>
    <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer). A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications</p>
